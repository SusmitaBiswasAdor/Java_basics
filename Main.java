// This is a simple Java program.

// 1 public class Main {accessible from any other class in any other package. Here the .java file must also be in the same name as the class name

// 2 class Main { only "class" without the public keyword, it is also known as "package-private", that is only accessible for code that is located in the same package.

// 3 public static void main(String[] args) { is the entry point of the program. The main() method is always public, static, with return type void, and a String array as an argument.

// println line space and print does not add a new line after the output.


// public class Main {
//     public static void main(String[] args)
